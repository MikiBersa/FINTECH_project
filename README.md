# Anomaly detection - BC3 - G9

Tips for reading the project correctly: below we define the steps for reading the code.

1. Read the preprocessing file: data analysis
2. Models: model training
3. Interpretability: analysis of model performance
4. ews_1: definition of the final models ews_1
5. ews_2: definition of the final models ews_2

the tools file is a library in which there are support functions for the project code

NB:

Since the FinancialMarketData file is read and written by the code it is not readable by excel, so we created a FinancialMarketData_readable version which is readable by excel in which we reported the same data stored in FinancialMarketData
